        You were tasked to get rid of all the flies. You managed to scare away almost all of them but there is only 1 remaining. You are equiped with a device that makes a clicking sound. When you are about 2 steps infront of the fly, it will let you know. Then click the game area to trigger the device that will then scare the fly away. How many times will you manage to successfully scare the fly away?<br/>
        Each time you scare the fly away, you will ofcorse  become frustrated and run a little faster. You are also constantly moving in 1 direction, closer to the fly. Good luck.
