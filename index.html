        You were tasked to get rid of all the flies. You managed to scare away
        almost all of them, but there is only one remaining. You are equipped
        with a device that makes a clicking sound. When you are about two steps
        in front of the fly, it will let you know. Then click the game area to
        trigger the device that will then scare the fly away. How many times
        will you manage to successfully scare the fly away?<br />
        Each time you scare the fly away, you will of corse become frustrated
        and run a little faster. You are also constantly moving in 1 direction,
        closer to the fly. Good luck.
